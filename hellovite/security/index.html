    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>X-Frame-Options: DENY : This option prevents clickjacking. Which is basically a way to trick the user
                into clicking on something different then intended.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block. This stops the website from loading the page when it detects cross-site
                scripting</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; this allows the admin to control resources a user is allowed
                to load for a given page. The "self" property only allows resources from the current origin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff. is a marker used by the serve to indicate the content types that should
                be followed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin. This policy controls how much referred information
                should be included with requests.</p>
            <p>strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default)
                Send the origin, path, and querystring when performing a same-origin request. For cross-origin requests
                send the origin (only) when the protocol security level stays same (HTTPS→HTTPS). Don't send the Referer
                header to less secure destinations (HTTPS→HTTP). Source: <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy">Mozilla</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(self), microphone=(), camera=(), fullscreen=*</p>
            <p>The permission policy defines a method for developers to selectively enable or disable certain browser
                features and APIs.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks to Netlify, this deployed website has the HTTPS protocol. Which means it has the SSL certificate which
        allows secure transfer of data in transit.</p>
    <p>This website is also inherently secure because it does not have any input fields aside from the bad example page.
        When the user only has a static page to visit and has minimal interaction with components of the website, it
        adds another layer of protection just by design. There is also no media on the website nor does it make any
        external calls to other servers that would otherwise increase the security risk.</p>
    <p>This site includes the _headers file with properties discussed above.</p>
