    <p>This is the quality assurance page</p>
    <h2>version control & branching model</h2>
    <p>This website is doing version control via github and is being deployed via the main/master branch</p>
    <h2>Code Linting and Ad Hoc testing</h2>
    <p>ESLint was used as the linter and Ad-Hoc testing done via JSHint</p>
    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>For unit testing i have incorporated MOCHA. I have installed it and added the script for mocha in package.json
        but
        don't have an actual test written because, well theres nothing to test.</p>
    <h2>end-to-end testing</h2>
    <p>This website doesn't qualify for end-to-end testing otherwise I would have incorporated Cypress or Playwright</p>
    <h2>Build Tool & Deployment Pipeline</h2>
    <p>The build tool used for this site is Vite and the Deployment pipeline is first via GitHub and then Netlify with
        continuous deployment turned ON.</p>
