    <p>This is the bad example page</p>

            <label for="user">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" name="user" />
            <label for="pass">Password:</label>

        Things wrong with this page:
    </h2>
    <p>
        This form has no front-end or back-end validation. The user is free to input any sort of value and characters.
        This essentially leaves your server and website vulnerable to injection attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no authentication process. anyone can try brute force attacks. Anyone can have any sort of password and
        username. There is no multi-factor authentication or any password recovery process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website does use HTTPS for data in transit but the user inputs are not encrypted or hashed in anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a user logs in, they are free to do anything they wish. They can visit any webpage or access any file on
        the website.
